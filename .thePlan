create universal settings hamburger and sidebar thingy.
(modular as usual in it's own js file.)


give the popup toaster a containing div that is the height of the
message - animate the bounce to something like -10%


Animate the words in time with the audio spoken words.
  could make the word bigger, bounce up a bit, change color, etc.


Loader:
  make a single loading bar:
    each file represents a portion of the entire bar,
    with it's progress being a percent of the overall portion
    of that file.
    example:
    10 files, means 1 file is a 10th of the entire bar when loaded.
    if that file was 50% loaded, it would be 50 diveded by 10 for the 
    actual progress bar.

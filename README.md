# Toddlearner
A Learning game for toddlers by StewVed
Play it directly within GitHub at:
https://stewved.github.io/toddlearner/

Featuring (experimental HTML5 standard) "Add to Homescreen" for
Android (chrome firefox browsers I think), and the ability to
play the game offline, like a native app.

Suggestions, tips/support, etc. welcome!
